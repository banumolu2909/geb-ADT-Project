# Purpose of the Project:
Hoosiers Delivery Management System is a web-based platform that enables users to conveniently manage and monitor their deliveries. We are utilizing a dataset from Kaggle which includes detailed information about orders, customers, and products. Using this application, the user can input the necessary delivery details such as the items to be delivered and their destination. Additionally, they have the ability to update the delivery status as delivered or in progress or not delivered. The application also allows for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations to be performed on the delivery data points.

# Technical Description:
# Model:
We are using MySQL Server as our database management system to store data for our web application.

# View:
For our front-end, we are using ReactJS to create a visually appealing and dynamic user interface using material UI components.

# Controller (Router):
For the back-end development, we are using NodeJS as the controller in our MVC architecture. NodeJS enables us to get the desired action in a single process without having to create a new thread for every new request.

# Data:
The dataset for this project has been taken from Kaggle. It consists of data regarding the delivery of products ordered throughout United States. We loaded the csv data file into MySQL workbench and the data is organized and structured into tables to minimize data redundancy and to ensure query efficiency using Normalization.
